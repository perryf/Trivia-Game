// Great job with the JS overall.  Code is semantically clear and functions well.
// There is a little bit of abstraction that could be done on some of the functions to make them smaller, more well defined, and specific.
// Beyond that, the biggest improvement in code quality would come from cleaning up and organizing.  Get rid of commented out lines, make sure nothing is redundent, and organize best you can to make everything a bit more readable and intuitive.
// Lastly, it might be a good idea to add a little bit of humor to match the content of this app.  Or a brief storyline to explain the health bar and engage the user even more.
// Overall great job!
